Empirical is a library of tools for developing efficient, reliable, and accessible scientific
software.  The provided code is all header-only and encapsulated into the emp namespace, so it
is simple to incorporate into existing projects.

See the doc/QuickStartGuides/ folder to start using the library.

Tools in Empirical include:
* Web-enabled elements to facilitate compiling to JavaScript and with a full web interfaces,
  using Mozilla's Emscripten compiler (from C++ to high-efficiency JavaScript).
* Debug tools to facilitate fast memory management, which are turned off outside of debug mode.
* Evolution tools for building Artificial Life or Evolutionary Computation software.
* Many other helper tools to streamline common scientific computing tasks (configuration,
  randomization, bit manipulation, etc.)

See https://empirical.readthedocs.io/en/latest/html/files.html for more detailed documentation
on the available source files.

# Development Status

Empirical is under heavy development.  As such, many source files have at least one of the
following statuses:

| Status | Meaning
| ------ | -------
| DESIGN | Notes are in place, but no (or minimal) working code
| ALPHA | Some basic functionality works, but more features still need to be added and tested
| BETA | Basic functionality is all in place, but needs more thorough testing.
| RELEASE | Well-tested functionality and used in multiple projects, at least by authors
| STABLE | Used by many non-authors in assorted projects without fixes for extended period
| ABANDONED | May have worked, or may not; no longer being developed
| BROKEN | Once worked (at least BETA level), but now needs to be repaired (not abandoned!)
| CLEANUP | At least BETA, but needs code cleanup, fixing of warnings, etc
| DEPRECATED | Functionality has been replaced and should shift to replacement.
| EXPLORATORY | Some functionality may work, but needs re-engineering to get right
| EXTERNAL | Part of another project (cited above); not developed as part of Empirical


# Levelization

The structure of Empirical is levelized to facilitate development and testing.  This means
that all directories are on a level where dependencies are either internal to that directory
or on lower levels.  Likewise, within a directory, files have a level and depend only on other
files at lower levels.

| Level | Folders
| ----  | ----
| 0 |  base/
| 1 |  meta/
| 2 |  tools/
| 3 |  config/  control/  data/  games/  geometry/  hardware/  scholar/
| 4 |  Evo/ (data, control)  web/ (config, control)
