The evo3 directory is for another attempt at rebuilding the World object, this time as a more
coherent object with all aspects configurable at RUN TIME.

Important variables:
 Fitness function
 Mutation function
 Synchronous vs. Asynchronous generations
 Population structure (i.e., where are organisms placed on birth and injection?)
 Fitness Caching on/off 
 Fitness Tracking on/off (or three levels?)
 Signals - with actions to be hooked in.
 Data

Additionally, organisms must be analyzed when inserted to configure the above, as appropriate.
